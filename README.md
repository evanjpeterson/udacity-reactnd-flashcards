# Flashcards Project (react native)

This is my project submission for the Udacity React Native course.

Users are able to create decks of flashcards and then quiz themselves on the questions in each deck.
The app uses persistent storage to track decks and cards.

So far I have only tested it on the **Android** platform, specifically my
LG G6 (LG US997) mobile phone.

## Try it out

* Steps:
    - `yarn install` to install dependencies
    - `yarn start` to start the Expo development server


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
